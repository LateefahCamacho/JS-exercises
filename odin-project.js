//Describe what a prototype is and how it can be used.
 //The prototype property is used primarily for inheritance; you add methods and properties on a functionâ€™s prototype property to make those methods and properties available to instances of that function.
//Explain prototypal inheritance
 //When a property from object is read and is missing Javascript automatically takes it from the prototype this is called prototypal inheritance.
//Explain what object.creates does
 // Object.creates extends objects from others.
//Explain how this behave in different situations
 //"this" is an inner function depends only on its own invocation type, but not on the outer function's context.To make this have a desired value, modify the inner function's context with indirect invocation (using .call() or .apply(), or create a bound function (using .bind().
